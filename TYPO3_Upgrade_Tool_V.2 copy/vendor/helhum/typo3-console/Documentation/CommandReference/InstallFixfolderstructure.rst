**Fix folder structure**

Automatically create files and folders, required for a TYPO3 installation.

This command creates the required folder structure needed for TYPO3 including extensions.
It is recommended to be executed **after** executing
`typo3cms install:generatepackagestates`, to ensure proper generation of
required folders for all active extensions.
