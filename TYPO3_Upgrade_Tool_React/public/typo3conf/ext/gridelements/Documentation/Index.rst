This TYPO3 extension extends the grid-based concept known from the backend
layout of pages to regular content elements.

The grid elements are - just like backend layouts - defined by TypoScript and
can thus be easily reused, extended and put under version control. It allows
nesting of grids, giving the backend editor a wide range of layout
possibilities. Its container nature encourages grouping content elements and
assigning them specific frontend renderings, for example to display an
accordion, tabs or galleries. Grid elements can be referenced to keep the
content structure slim. The focus is always on the usability of the backend
editor, which is supported by an advanced drag & drop handling and a granular
configuration setting to define rules per grid element.
